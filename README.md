## What is GoReleaser Pro?

GoReleaser Pro is a fork of the OSS version you already use everyday, with extra features.

With GoReleaser Pro you can:

- Continuously release [nightly builds](https://goreleaser.com/customization/nightly/);
- Import pre-built binaries with the [`prebuilt` builder](https://goreleaser.com/customization/build/#import-pre-built-binaries);
- Rootless build [Docker images](https://goreleaser.com/customization/docker/#podman) and [manifests](https://goreleaser.com/customization/docker_manifest/#podman) with [Podman](https://podman.io);
- Easily create `apt` and `yum` repositories with the [fury.io integration](https://goreleaser.com/customization/fury/);
- Reuse configuration files with the [include keyword](https://goreleaser.com/customization/includes/);
- Run commands after the release with [global after hooks](https://goreleaser.com/customization/hooks/);
- Use GoReleaser within your [monorepo](https://goreleaser.com/customization/monorepo/);
- Create [custom template variables](https://goreleaser.com/customization/templates/#custom-variables) (goes well with [includes](https://goreleaser.com/customization/includes/)).

And more features will be added soon.

The idea is to make this more sustainable.
I have invested a lot of time in GoReleaser, some people contribute (either with code or money), most people don't.
I'm not a big fan of receiving money without giving something in return, so this is my try at it.

## What's next for GoReleaser OSS?

I'll continue to maintain and add features as I already do.
The only difference is that features that feel more "enterprisy" will be added to the paid version instead (unless someone contributes the code for it).
